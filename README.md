# Power-BI-Analysis
The repository consists of an analysis made using Power-BI for brand performance comparison.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use Case:

Attached you will find two different brands with its performance and investment data. Both
brands (Marke 1 & Marke 2) are playing a significant role in our portfolio. Unfortunately, the SEA
investment data was only available at a monthly level. See separate table in the workbook.
Marke 1 has no specific seasonality. Marke 2 however has a seasonality during the winter period.
The CEO is interested in the performance of the first 26 weeks of the year and wants a deep dive
analysis of both brands to decide if an extra investment on top of 25% of the current investment
in Marke 1 or Marke 2 would make sense for the upcoming 26 weeks.
Task:
Please analyse and visualize Marke 1 and Marke 2 in terms of
• Turnover development
• Investment development
• Profitability
What kind of conclusions / recommendations would you provide on the current state of the
brands?
Please provide a potential planning scenario for the second half of the year.
Consider an extra investment of 25%, if you think it could accelerate brand growth.
Note:
Please assume that product costs of Marke 1 and Marke 2 are equal and can therefore be
ignored for the case.
